        “The palace will be located in Wolcheon, with two parts, Woljeong Bridge and Chunyang Bridge.”
        After 10 years of collaborative investigation, historical research, and restoration of what was lost and disappeared during the Joseon Dynasty, 
        all restoration was completed in April 2018. In 2013, the bridge was selected for restoration, and the gate tower (motor gate) of the bridge was built separately.
        On the second floor of the gate tower, there is an exhibition hall where you can view videos of the bridge's restoration process and excavated artifacts.
        We can see the entirety of Woljeong Bridge during the day, and Woljeong Bridge at night tempts us with another charm.
        The person on the other side of Woljeong Bridge is the person looking at Woljeong Bridge. You can capture Woljeong Bridge shining softly over the river.'''

        Hwangridan-gil is the youngest road in Gyeongju. It refers to the area around Hwangnam-dong and Sajeong-dong on both sides of the road starting from Naenam Intersection to Hwangnam Elementary School Intersection.
        A few years ago, young people began to gather here, and cafes with a nice atmosphere, cute props, souvenir shops, and unique restaurants opened.
        In the beginning, shops were built mainly along the roadside, but as the outer edge of Hwangridan-gil expanded, unique shops began popping up in every alley.
        It is so hot that it has become an essential course that cannot be missed when traveling to Gyeongju.
        Go to the cafe you were looking for, knock on the door of a restaurant that catches your eye while walking, or go to the last stage of your Gyeongju trip to get a cute souvenir to commemorate Gyeongju. Let’s eat, drink, and have fun on Hwangridan-gil.

        It is an astronomical observatory from the Silla Dynasty that observed the movement of celestial bodies. It had a cylindrical part shaped like a liquor bottle on top of the stylobate, which served as a pedestal, and a crown shaped like the letter 井 on top. It is approximately 9m high.
    The cylindrical part is made of 27 layers of fan-shaped stones, and compared to the smooth and well-trimmed exterior, the interior walls are uneven due to the back roots of the stones sticking out. Centered around the southeastern window, the lower part is filled with masonry stones, and the upper part is open to the top and is hollow. The eastern half of the summit is blocked by flagstones, and the ends of long stones interlocked in the shape of the letter 井 protrude to the outside. This type of appearance is also found in levels 19 to 20 and levels 25 to 26, and appears to have been suitable for carrying a ladder inside. According to an old record, “people are supposed to go up in the middle,” and it appears that they placed a ladder outside, went inside through the window, and then used the ladder to climb to the top and observe the sky.
    Astronomy is deeply related to agriculture in that it can determine the timing of farming based on the movement of the sky, and is also related to politics, given that astrology, which predicted good or bad times for a country based on observation results, was considered important in ancient countries. You can see how deep this is. Therefore, it became a matter of great national interest from early on, and it is believed that this served as a good background for the construction of Cheomseongdae.
    It is believed to have been built during the reign of Queen Seondeok of Silla (reign 632-647). It is of great value as the oldest astronomical observatory in the East and can be said to be a valuable national heritage that shows the high level of science at the time.
