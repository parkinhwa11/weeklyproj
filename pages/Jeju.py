        If you walk along Jeju Olle Course 19, you can come across Hamdeok Beach, which has emerald jewels. Hamdeok Beach, located in Hamdeok-ri, Jocheon-eup, Jeju-si, is also called ‘Hamdeok Seoubong Beach’ thanks to the tall volcano (Seoubong Peak) that stands right next to the beach.
        Although it is only 20km away from Jeju Airport, the moment you arrive here, you feel like you have arrived in another country. The tall palm trees that welcome you from the entrance, the emerald sea contrasting with the white sand, and the clear water and white waves that transparently reflect even the sand and seaweed.
        Among the numerous beaches on Jeju Island, the three beaches with the prettiest sea colors are definitely Hyeopjae, Gimnyeong, and Hamdeok Beach. The water is clear and shallow, making it a good summer resort for families. The west side of the beach is connected by a cloud bridge, allowing you to experience the experience of walking on the sea.
        The lawn, which is great for picnics, and the walking trail where you can enjoy the sea safely at night are attractive, so there is a constant flow of visitors all year round. Especially in summer, it is open at night, so you can enjoy Jeju’s blue nights at the sea.
        Seoubong Peak, located right next to it, presents picturesque scenery every season with yellow rape flowers in spring and green in summer. If you climb Seoubong Peak, you can enjoy the luxury of a panoramic view of Hamdeok Beach. If the weather is good, it is the best observation point from which you can overlook Hallasan Mountain and the eastern oreums.

         Camellia Hill is the largest camellia arboretum in the East, where you can see over 500 varieties of camellia flowers from over 80 countries, including native camellias, baby camellias, and European camellias.
        There are many cute photo spots in the arboretum, so it is especially popular among tourists with couples and families. During the season when camellia flowers bloom, there is a constant stream of people coming to take wonderful photos with the camellia flowers in full bloom as a background.
        Where are there only camellia flowers? When summer begins, hydrangea flowers resembling the blue sky greet visitors, and in fall, silver grass and pink muhly fill the fall garden. Thanks to the new changes of clothes each season, it boasts a 100% success rate for taking the perfect shot no matter what time of day you visit.
        Not only the Bird Song Wind Sound Road, which is known as the background of the Innisfree CF, but also the traditional Olle Road with Jeju's stone walls and the emotional forest path with twinkling yellow light bulbs are also must-take photo points. There are so many photo spots in every nook and cranny that you will lose track of time as you take pictures here and there.
        A walk around Camellia Hill takes approximately 40 minutes to 1 hour and 20 minutes. We recommend that you allow plenty of time to visit.

        Seongsan Ilchulbong, unlike other volcanic cones on Jeju Island, is a water-based volcano formed when magma erupts from under the water. As the hot magma ejected during volcanic activity meets cold seawater, the volcanic ash retains a lot of moisture and becomes sticky, and this piles up in layers to form Seongsan Ilchulbong.
        The sedimentary layers near the sea were eroded by waves and currents, creating the steep slopes they have today. When it was created, it was an island separate from the mainland of Jeju. As sand and gravel piled up around it, a road was created that connected it to the mainland at low tide. In 1940, a road was built here, and it is now perfectly connected to the mainland.
        When you climb to the top, you can see a crater with a width of about 80,000 pyeong, which is concave like a bowl and has grass such as silver grass growing inside. There are 99 high peaks (rocks) surrounding the crater. It was named ‘Seongsan (城山)’ because it looks like a huge castle, and ‘Ilchulbong (日出峰)’ because the view of the sun rising is spectacular.
        According to legend, if Seongsan Ilchulbong had 100 buds, wild beasts like tigers and lions would have appeared in Jeju as well, but since one is not enough, the number is 99, so neither tigers nor lions would appear.
