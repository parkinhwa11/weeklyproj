           Gwanbangje is an embankment on Gwanbangcheon Stream that is 6km long from Dongja Village in Namsan-ri, Damyang-eup, through Hwanggeum-ri, Subuk-myeon, to Gangneung-ri, Daejeon-myeon. 
           The reason why Gwanbangje is famous is because it forms a huge forest spanning about 2km. This scenic forest is called Gwanbangjerim, and it is densely packed with trees estimated to be 300 to 400 years old in an area of 49,228 m2. 
           Because of its beauty, it was designated as a natural monument on November 27, 1991, and in 2004, it won the grand prize at the ‘5th Beautiful Forest National Competition’ hosted by the Korea Forest Service. 
           The main tree species are Pujo tree (111 trees), Hackberry tree (18 trees), Cherry tree (9 trees), Yin tree (1 tree), Hornbeam tree (1 tree), Bear's horseradish, and Japanese oak. 
           There are about 420 trees growing there. . Currently, 185 old, large trees are growing in the area designated as a natural monument. 
           In addition, Gwanbangjerim is in the spotlight as a summer resort and is also widely known as a date spot for young couples. 
           Chuseong Stadium is located on the highlands around Gwanbangjerim, and a sculpture park with folk tales was built in 2005, adding to the attractions.
           In order to control the waterway of Damyangcheon, the upper stream of the Yeongsangang River, the government embankment system was established by the governor Seong Iseong (成以性) who built an embankment and planted trees. 
           Afterwards, in 1854 (the 5th year of King Cheoljong's reign), the governor Hwang Jong-rim (黃鍾林) became the official secretary. It is said that it was named Gwanbangje because it was built by mobilizing 30,000 people.

        It is Korea's first national garden and one of the world's five largest coastal wetlands.
        Suncheon Bay National Garden, created to protect Suncheon Bay, has 790,000 trees of 505 species and 3.15 million flowers of 113 species planted on 1.12 million m2 (340,000 pyeong) of garden land in the Dosa-dong area of Suncheon.
        In spring, tulips and azaleas burst into flower buds, creating a spectacular sight. In addition, 30,000 m2 around the Sharing Forest was created as a rapeseed flower complex, which blooms all at once in mid-May, creating a wave of yellow.
        The city planted 50,000 hackberry trees and zelkova trees along major traffic routes to create natural shade. A small unmanned track train (PRT) is also in operation between Suncheon Bay Garden and Suncheon Literature Museum (4.64km).
        Visitors who have fully explored the garden can take the PRT to the Literature Museum, get off, and then take the reed train for the 1.2km distance to Mujingyo Bridge at the entrance to Suncheon Bay.
        We also operate eco-friendly transportation methods such as Sky Cube, a sky taxi that connects Suncheon Bay National Garden and wetlands.

        Yi Sun-sin Square, located in Jungang-dong, Yeosu, is a place where you can see and feel the historical scene, including information on Admiral Yi Sun-sin, who led the Japanese invasions of Korea to victory and an introduction to the volunteer army at the time.
        The square is the starting point of a historical, cultural and tourism belt linked to surrounding historic sites such as Jinnamgwan, where Admiral Yi Sun-sin developed his military plans and issued military orders.
        The Turtle Ship Festival, the oldest patriotic cultural festival in Korea, is held every May.
        The most eye-catching structure here is the Turtle Ship, which is reproduced close to its original form.
        It was designed not only for its exterior appearance but also for viewing from the inside.
        If you go inside the turtle ship, you can feel the dynamic appearance of the naval forces and vivid scenes from the Japanese invasions of Korea during the Japanese invasions of Korea.
        You can also try simple experiences. There were three turtle ships that were active during the Japanese invasions, one each built at the Jeolla Jwasuyeong, Bangdapjin, and Suncheonbu shipyards.
        The location of the turtle ship is exactly where the Jeolla Jwasuyeong shipyard was located.
        On one side of Yi Sun-sin Square, there is a mural depicting the life of Admiral Yi Sun-sin and the process of the Japanese invasions of Korea.
