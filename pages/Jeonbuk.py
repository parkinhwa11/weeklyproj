Gyeonggijeon Hall was destroyed during the reign of Jeong Yu-jae in the 30th year of King Seonjo (1597), but it was rebuilt in the 6th year of King Gwanghaegun (1614). Gyeonggijeon consists of Hamabyeong, a red-colored Hongsalmun, a foreign newspaper, an internal newspaper, and a Jeongjeon Hall dedicated to Eojin.'''

intro = '''Gyeongam-dong Cheolgil Village was completed in 1944 in Gyeongam-dong, Gunsan-si, Jeollabuk-do, and was named after the village around the 2.5 km railroad that connects the Paper Korea factory and Gunsan Station. The origin of the name was that the village formed around the railroad was called Gyeongam-dong Cheolgil Village according to the name of the administrative district where the village was located. In 1944, people began to live around the railroad, which was opened during the Japanese occupation, and in the 1970s, the village was formed naturally. Although trains do not run now, the railroad tracks remain as they are, stimulating modern memories. The Gyeongam-dong Railway was first opened in 1944 during the Japanese occupation to carry newspaper materials. It was called the 'North Line Paper Railway' until the mid-1950s, and after the early 1970s it was called the 'Generation Paper Line' or the 'Sepung Railway', but after the newly acquired company went bankrupt, it is now called the 'Paper Korea Line'. Gyeongam-dong Cheolgil Village is famous for a retro sensibility by recreating the scenery of the 1970s and 1980s. Old houses and shops remain everywhere, so you can feel as if you have traveled back in time. In addition, it sells drawing, dalgona, and ddakji on both sides of the railroad track, and is popular with travelers as there are food and entertainment such as taking pictures in old school uniforms.'''
