            Geochang Iris Garden is located in Wolpyeong-ri, Namsang-myeon, and was located in a submerged area when the Hapcheon Dam was built in 1988.
    This is the place where farmers have been growing rice.
    In Geochang-gun, an ecological garden that matches the waterside scenery of the Hwanggang River, a national river, was created to reduce agricultural pollution sources.
    Geochang Iris Garden was created to protect river water quality and revitalize the local economy through tourism resources.
    Iris is a plant that purifies water and has the traditional custom and practicality of washing one's hair on Danot Day.
    Iris has a beautiful appearance, as its name comes from the meaning of 'blooming more beautiful flowers than irises.'
    It is a very beautiful flower.
    In the spring, more than 1 million irises planted form a beautiful colony, and in the summer, the theme is lotus, water lily, and hydrangea.
    There are four seasons with the theme of chrysanthemums and maple leaves in the fall, and silver grass and reeds around the tropical botanical garden, reservoir, and wetlands in the winter.

        The name ‘Dongpirang’ was created by combining the words ‘east’ and ‘birang.’ ‘Birang’ is a Tongyeong dialect word for ‘vital’, and it is made by adding only ‘dong’ from the word ‘east’, so people came to call it ‘Dongpirang.’ The Green Tongyeong 21 Promotion Council gathered people nationwide to paint on Dongpirang Road in October 2007. Those people painted pictures all over the village walls, walls, roads, etc., and the seaside hill village was reborn as a painting. Dongpirang Alley has dozens of branches. A village with paintings in every alley and touching the sky. The paintings there are enough to turn the village into a fairyland. Additionally, the Gangguan seascape seen from the village is also worth seeing.
        Tongyeong City initially had a plan to demolish Dongpirang Village and restore Dongporu, the old Jejeongyeong building installed by Chungmugong. In 2007, a civic group called 'Blue Tongyeong 21' opened the 'Dongpirang Coloring - National Mural Contest' in Dongpirang Village under the slogan, "Even a daldongnae can become beautiful if you take care of it." Accordingly, art students from all over the country gathered and began painting murals on old walls in every alley.

         Many people gather to ride sleds in Tongyeong, a southern city full of warm spring energy. This is to ride the ‘Skyline Luge’, which can only be enjoyed in 6 places around the world. Luge is an amusement facility where you ride a specially designed cart without a special power device and run on a track using only the slope of the ground and gravity. It was first invented in Rotorua, New Zealand, and opened in Tongyeong as the 6th location, following New Zealand (2 locations), Canada (2 locations), and Singapore (1 location).
    As soon as it opened in February 2017, it was so crowded with users that people had to wait in line for more than two hours on weekends. Still, luge’s popularity does not fade. There are relatively few users early on weekend mornings or on weekdays, so if you want to use it leisurely, it is best to avoid crowded times.
    Skyline Luge has the same name as the winter sport luge, but it is much safer and easier. You can think of it as a sled with steering wheels and wheels that can control direction. The operation is as simple as a sled, so even children taller than 110cm can ride on their own. Children between 85 and 110 cm tall must be accompanied by a guardian.
